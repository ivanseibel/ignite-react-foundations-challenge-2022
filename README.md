Revisiting the foundations of React using Vite, React and Typescript.

In this challenge, the developer needs to create a task management application in the style of **to-do list** that includes the following features:

- Create a new task.
- Check and uncheck a task as completed 
- Remove a completed task from the list 
- Display the progress of completed tasks

Despite the fact this is an extremely simple project, it's still a good opportunity to test React concepts like:

- States
- Immutability of the state
- Lists and keys in ReactJS
- Properties
- Componentization

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To run this project you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. I personally recommend using some node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n). You don't need to install npm separately as it comes with Node.js.
